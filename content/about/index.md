This is a **creative** outlet for my **photography** and **videos**.-

I love to take pictures, shoot videos and **play** with them but realized I needed an outlet so I created this concept.-

The idea of **Phone Prove** is to try and see what can be achieved using **only phone cameras**.-

I took the challenge after seeing several YouTube videos talking about how the photographer is a lot more important than the equipment and I wanted to experiment.-
