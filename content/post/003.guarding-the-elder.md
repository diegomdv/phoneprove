Took it during a family trip to Argentina, inside the "[Cementerio de la Recoleta][1]", where lots of historical characters from Argentina are burried.-

Being Argentinian and working in Buenos Aires for so long, I've never gone inside the Recoleta cemetery before, and it was quite a surprise. Not only it was beautiful and peaceful but also full of well known Argentinian characters.-

This is the vault for [Bartolom√© Mitre][2], former president of Argentina.-
