This was part of a long weekend trip to [Bacalar][1], Mexico. I woke up very early in the morning to enjoy the lake and was inspired by this lamp.-

We've arrived to Bacalar the night before and spent the night having some drinks and talking under that exact same lamp, enjoying the view of the lake. I vividly remember the moment of this picture, I desperately needed a break from my everyday routine and work and I couldn't resist to wonder about the simplicity but importance of the light, and how peaceful it's "life" is.-
