This one was at the observation deck at [Lago Traful][1] on our way to Villa La Angostura. This is a very special image as it captured...

... the exact moment of wonder of one of my daughters. She was astonished at the amazing view around here, the immersive feeling of nature and the vastness of the lake and mountains.-

This one will always be one of my favorite shots of that trip.-
