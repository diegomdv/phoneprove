Part of my Patagonia Argentina 2016 / 2017 trip. Taken on cold and windy day. Once we arrived, I could't believe...

...I was staring at the "shortest river in the world". Then we went down and that river lead to this spectacular view.-

This is the *back* view of the [Correntoso Lake & River][1], an incredible property with an awesome view. I wasn't able to stay there in this trip, but it is definitely on my bucket list from that moment on.-

My friend kept telling me about his teenage stories about fishing in the river, fighting for a spot and getting great catches there.-
