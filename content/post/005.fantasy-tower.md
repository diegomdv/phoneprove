Taken on May 2017, on our summer holiday family trip. This Rapunzel tower was being built the first time we went to World Disney World and it was a special request...
<!--more-->

...from my niece, who specifically asked me to take pictures of "every bit of Rapunzel thing I could find".-

We were hoping this was something you can get close to or even get inside, but it was just a feature added as a background for the Entangled / Rapunzel area of the park.-

The composition was "meh" but I had to comply with my niece's request.-

I share this because it was a good challenge to make something that looked so far away to look good on a picture taken with an iPhone 7 Plus.-
