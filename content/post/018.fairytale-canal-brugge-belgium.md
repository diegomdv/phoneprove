Brugge was an amazing place, even when it was filled with people it never felt too crowded, the only downside that day was...

... the heat. It was a supper hot and humid day and you could feel it.-

We took a boat ride through the canals late in the afternoon, we were tired after so much walking so it was good to sit down for a bit.-

I wanted to capture the feeling inside the boat I was, it was hard to find a good angle while dealing with the constant changing of light, the movement and the difficult angles.-
... uncommon one's I was after for quite some time.-

That was probably the best shot during the boat ride, but not good enough compared to what I was looking for.-
Nevertheless I was pleased with the results. I see it now and I can re-live the feeling I had at that moment.-
